Quick number guesser (JavaScript, CSS, HTML)

## JavaScript Number Guesser
Quick little "project challenge" I found within the Full-Stack Engineering course of Codecademy. 

## Functionality â›“
This repository consists of an HTML file, a CSS stylesheet and 2 JavaScript files. The JavaScript
performs actions as follows:

- Show the current round's number and increment it by one after every round
- Generate a randomized target number between 0 and 9, both inclusively
- Generate a randomized guess for the computer to play against
- Letting the User choose a number within the borders used for generating the target number
- Calculating and displaying a winner by smallest absolute distance
- Increasing the winner's score by one after every won round
